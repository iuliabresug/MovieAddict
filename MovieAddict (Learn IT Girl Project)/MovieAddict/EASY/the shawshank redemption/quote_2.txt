"I find I'm so excited, I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head. 
I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel, 
a free man at the start of a long journey whose conclusion is uncertain. 
I hope I can make it across the border. I hope to see my friend and shake his hand. 
I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams. I hope."
