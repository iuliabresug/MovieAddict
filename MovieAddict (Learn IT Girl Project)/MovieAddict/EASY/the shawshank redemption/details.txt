In 1946, a banker named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted of a double murder, even though he stubbornly proclaims 
his innocence. He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, 
Ellis "Red" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. 
The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led 
by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings
to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which
(together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars.
