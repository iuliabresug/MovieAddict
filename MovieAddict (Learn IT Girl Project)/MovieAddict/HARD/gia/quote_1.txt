"What am I supposed to feel here? Sorry for you because you're beautiful? 
Because you made ten thousand a minute doing fuckin' nothing? "Oh it was so hard, so terrible, they treated me so bad." 
Listen girl, you had a free ride. And you fuckin' blew it. And me? 
I'm some kid from Ohio, reading fashion magazines, looking at your picture and thinking I'm supposed to look like that."
